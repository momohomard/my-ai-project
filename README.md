# My First AI Project

This is a simple Python script that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API to generate text responses.

## How it works
- Takes a prompt from the user
- Sends it to OpenAI API
- Prints the AI's response

## Usage
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements: `pip install openai`
3. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:  
   `export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
4. Run the script: `python gpt_example.py`
